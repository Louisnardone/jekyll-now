Problems of competition 

In this lesson we learnt about what would be the outcome of having pornography on the media. In the example we used, there was a competition to be the first to get one a million subscribers. When this got out of control one wanted revenge and filmed another having sex. 

What I learnt is:

That if you put something on the internet then it will stay there even if you delete it.

If people know you that may think you are some sort of sex addict and think badly of you  and may ask for sex and sent hurtful messages.

If it is your phone then people will ask for more or criticise you.

However there are people and websites that can help you overcome these problems and get rid of it. Also most people that are friends will support you.
