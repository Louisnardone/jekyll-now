    <td>Did I reach my target?</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I achieved the work on my own, writing my own code and changing the variables accordingly.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought about what I had done with previous tasks on turtle - except with task 1 which I thought about the work I did on Codeacademy.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was fully engaged trying to get the work done within the time of the lesson and to a high quality.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning could of gone better if I knew what the code was to repeat a set instructions over a certain number of times so that the code I did was exact (not more or less lines of the shape) and It would have been easier to extend myself - I tried to do a 40 sided shape.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will ask for what the code would be or try different ideas to see what would work, such as "Turtle.repeat(40)" then the two lines of code instead of writing “Turtle. Turn Left (9)” and “Turtle.forward(20)”</td>
