    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To complete tasks 7-13 on the google classroom docs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?</td>
    <td>Absolutely. I managed to complete tasks 1-12, however I could have moved on from 12 to 13 with plenty of time but spent a long time on 12.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I kept trying different angles and combinations of code in number 12 to get the best star I could - 18 pointed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I tried different angles to make the star and different ways of making the star using the repeat or loop code line.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked alone on the task completing it with no help from others.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I used the work last lesson to help understand what to write as the instructions were vager and didn't give you the correct code to write so I used the knowledge of "turtle." and instructions to help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was intrigued by the task to see what I could figure out to do in the time of the lesson to the best of my ability.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning could of gone better if I changed the way I made the shapes to the way the teacher had showed on the board rather than sticking to my original technique.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will save the work on the one with my own technique and then start another using the technique shown on the board so I can have a go at both to see which was better help and keep to that one but still be able to use my one if I felt it was better.</td>
