    <td>A comment that made me feel good was "I really like your detail and the secret drawings in invisible ink, they really add something about your personality. I like your ambitions, Detail and effort!" and “You have colourful pictures that make your work stand out. You have a lot of detailed writing. You have put a lot of effort and it has definitely paid off, Well Done!”. But on ethat made me feel not so good was “It is quite blank. You could have used different colours to make it more vibrant.”.
